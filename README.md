Publish temperature read from Arduino Uno (Akeru) TD1208 chip into sigfox's network

This is a short code example of reading the temperature from a TD1208 chip in the Akeru beta 3.3 board and publish it to SIGFOX's IoT network.

The board is this one: http://snootlab.com/shields-snootlab/829-.html

And here is a description of the workshop where I learned about SIGFOX: http://blog.joaopedromartins.net/2016/02/sigfox-makers-tour-lisbon.html


I don't exacly know why, but after some executions the temperature reading starts coming out as garbled characters, after a few successful executions. Any help would be appreciated.
