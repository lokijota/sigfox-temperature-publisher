# sigfox-temperature-publisher
This is a short code example of reading the temperature from a TD1208 chip in the Akeru beta 3.3 (Arduino Uno) board and publish it to SIGFOX's IoT network.

The board is this one: http://snootlab.com/shields-snootlab/829-.html

And here is a description of the workshop where I learned about SIGFOX: http://blog.joaopedromartins.net/2016/02/sigfox-makers-tour-lisbon.html


I don't exacly know why, but after a few successful calls the temperature reading starts coming back as garbled characters. Any help would be appreciated.
